# Where To Live
## This is the repository for our project.
We are working on a project that will showcase different regional areas in Finland for someone who might be interested in moving.

Today we began introducing ourselves on how to convert our upcoming data into SQL-format with a converter. We also downloaded MariaDB, as we want to turn the data into more readable format and also look at it in a database.
We also added Google Hybrid -map into GIS, as it gives a more refined UI on our map compared to OpenStreetMap, and it's more user-friendly while looking for a place to live. We looked for more information on our upcoming steps and are trying to figure out how to implement our data on to the map.
We also updated our project plan and returned it once again.

## 24.9.2021
Today we started looking into Python and 'Pandas', in order to import excel files (our data for the project) into python, and from there, to our map.
We downloaded Anaconda and Pandas and used some time to familiarize ourselves with these. We also tried to find some more open data that we could use and implement onto our map. Familiarizing ourselves with new platforms takes surprisingly a lot of time.





## 29.9.2021 

Today we started by checking out the possible functionality of Pandas. In its current state we tried to run the commands on the Anaconda Prompt by using "activate name_of_my_env" but quickly realized that the directory was out of place. We got an error saying that the commands were not recognized as internal or external commands by the prompt. After this we headed over to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-up-virtual-environment-for-python-using-anaconda/ and started to install a new environment into Anaconda Prompt by using the command "conda create -n envname python=x.x anaconda" where we specified the name for our environment as "pandamaailma" and the version as version 3.9.
